This lab aims to practice handling binary formatted data structures and files. Please follow the steps below to complete this lab.

1.  Please download a challenge file from this URL:
    
        https://inp.zoolab.org/binflag/challenge?id=<your-student-id>
        
    
    You can use tools like `wget` or `curl` to download your own challenge file. Remember to use your student id to download the file.
    

2.  The downloaded challenge file is a customized file with the following file formats. It is composed of a file header, a number of data blocks, and the flag information. You can reconstruct a _**dictionary file**_ ùê∑ÔøΩ using the blocks in the challenge file. You can then retrieve the flag hidden in ùê∑ÔøΩ using the flag information structure. Please read the formats carefully. A sample figure to illustrate the layout of the challenge file is as follows.

3.  File header: The file header is defined using the structure:
    
        typedef struct {
            uint64_t magic;     /* 'BINFLAG\x00' */
            uint32_t datasize;  /* in big-endian */
            uint16_t n_blocks;  /* in big-endian */
            uint16_t zeros;
        } __attribute((packed)) binflag_header_t;
        
    
    The `magic` is a fixed string of value `BINFLAG\x00`. The `datasize` is the total size of the dictionary file ùê∑ÔøΩ. The `n_blocks` is the total number of blocks in the challenge file. Note that some blocks might be bad blocks, i.e., having an incorrect checksum. You should not consider bad blocks when reconstructing ùê∑ÔøΩ.
    
4.  Based on the `n_blocks` defined in the file header, there are `n_blocks` data blocks placed right after the file header. The data structure for each data block is as follows.
    
        typedef struct {
            uint32_t offset;        /* in big-endian */
            uint16_t cksum;         /* XOR'ed results of each 2-byte unit in payload */
            uint16_t length;        /* ranges from 1KB - 3KB, in big-endian */
            uint8_t  payload[0];
        } __attribute((packed)) block_t;
        
    
    The `offset` is the offset of the payload in ùê∑ÔøΩ. The `length` is the length of the `payload`. By using the `offset` and the `length` of each data block, you have to copy the payload of a data block to the corresponding offset in ùê∑ÔøΩ. Note that you have to check the validity of a data block by using the `cksum` field. In case a data block does not pass the check, you should not use the bad data block.
    
5.  The flag information is placed right after all data blocks. The data structure for the flag information is as follows.
    
        typedef struct {
           uint16_t length;        /* length of the offset array, in big-endian */
           uint32_t offset[0];     /* offset of the flags, in big-endian */
        } __attribute((packed)) flag_t;
        
    
    With the flag information and content of the resulting dictionary file ùê∑ÔøΩ,  
    you should be able to retrieve the flag by using the offset values in the `offset` array. Each offset in the flag information points to _**two successive flag characters**_ in ùê∑ÔøΩ. By concatenating the flag characters pointed by the offsets in order, you should get the complete flag.
    
6.  Convert your flag into a hexadecimal string and send it to the flag verification service at:
    
        https://inp.zoolab.org/binflag/verify?v=<your-flag-in-hexadecimal>
        
    
    Suppose the FLAG is `FLAG|aaa|bbb|ccc`. You should convert the flag to `464c41477c6161617c6262627c636363` and submit it to our flag verification service. Note that the `FLAG|aaa|bbb|ccc` is not a valid flag and cannot pass the flag verification service‚Äôs check. Here is another demo flag that can pass the verification.
    
        464c41477c87b30fbafbbdbcf6188f00e4291c8aa1
        
    
7.  The regular flag extracted from a downloaded challenge server is in the format.
    
        FLAG|id|datetime|random-bytes
        
    
    You may play with our demo challenge file from [here (demo2.bin)](https://inp.zoolab.org/netprog/lab02/demo2.bin).
    
8.  You have to implement the challenge file decoder program in C or C++.
    
9.  A minimized demo file can be downloaded from [here (demo1.bin)](https://inp.zoolab.org/netprog/lab02/demo1.bin). It has only 286 bytes, and the hex dump of this file is as follows.

    The challenge file contains 6 blocks, and the dictionary file reconstructed from the challenge file is 128 bytes. The flag information indicates that there are 11 offsets in the sequence \[64, 98, 58, 86, 26, 10, 92, 94, 14, 8, 96\]. The flag hidden in the challenge file is `464c41477c78a9a214423cd0fb4b9c0bbd9c4d8ff0a4` (or a byte string `FLAG|x\xa9\xa2\x14B<\xd0\xfbK\x9c\x0b\xbd\x9cM\x8f\xf0\xa4`).

1.  \[20%\] You can decode the flag from the `demo2.bin` file and pass the verification service‚Äôs check.
    
2.  \[70%\] You can decode the flag downloaded from the challenge server and pass the verification service‚Äôs check.
    
3.  \[10%\] You can implement a single command to a) download a challenge file from the server using your id, b) decode the flag, and c) verify the flag. You can implement a shell script to perform the automation, but step (b) should be performed by the program you implemented in (2).
