# Static Web Server

## Description

This lab aims to practice implementing a web server that hosts static web content. Please follow the instructions and have fun!

1. Please download the homework development and testing package (or HW package for short) from [here](https://inp.zoolab.org/netprog/hw01/hw_staticweb_v1.tbz). With the HW package, you should be able to implement your homework offline.

   :::warning
   The HW package should be compatible with the following runtime:
   - Docker in native Linux, Mac OS, and WSL. If you use M1/M2, ensure you have Rosetta installed.
   - Docker in the classroom virtual machine
   :::

   :::danger
   We have updated the homework package to support:
   - A builder docker instance.
   - Revised sample codes to read port numbers and document root path from command line.

   Additional notes will be highlighted in red texts or red blocks.
   :::

1. To play with the HW package, unpack the files and run `docker-compose up -d` in the unpacked `hw_staticweb` directory. The command creates three containers.
   - `sw_lighttpd`, a minimal [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/) installation that is for you to inspect how a web server works.
   - `sw_demo`, a dummy web server implementation that does nothing but simply close a connected client connection, and
   - `sw_tester`, a docker used for testing your implementation.
   - `sw_builder`, &lt;i style=&#34;color:red&#34;&gt;a docker used for building your source codes. This would be useful if you run everything from native Mac OS or Windows terminal instead of a Linux OS.&lt;/i&gt;

   If you want to rebuild all the dockers, e.g., rebuild from an updated package, you may use the following commands:
   
```bash
docker-compose stop # stop all containers
docker-compose rm # remove all containers
docker-compose up -d --build
```


1. The `sw_lighttpd` container exports HTTP and HTTPS servers on ports 10801 and 10841. You can access the service using command lines such as

```bash
curl http://localhost:10801/
curl -k https://localhost:10841/
```


You can also visit the URLs using your browser. Alternatively, here are two other URLs for demo purposes [http-based](http://localhost:10801/demo.html) and [https-based](https://localhost:10841/demo.html).

:::danger
Because the server uses a self-signed certificate, you may receive warning messages on connecting to the server.
:::

1. You must implement your static web server in the `demo` directory. You can modify anything in the `demo` directory, but please ensure that you can produce a *statically linked* executable named `server` in the directory (using `make` command).

:::danger
We demonstrate the compilation process on a native Linux OS with with docker runtime. In that case, you can use the `make` commands in the console. However, if you work with native Windoiws or Mac OS console, you may use `make builder` to compile files in `./demo` directory. 
:::

1. The `sw_demo` container invokes the `server` executable placed in the demo container. Similar to the `sw_lighttpd` container, it also exports two ports, 10802 and 10842, for accepting HTTP and HTTPS services, respectively. The container may keep restarting if the `server` executable cannot be invoked appropriately.

1. To test your implementation, run the command
```bash
docker exec -it sw_tester /testcase/run.sh lighttpd
```

- or -

```bash
docker exec -it sw_tester /testcase/run.sh demo
```

The last parameter determines whether you run the test cases against the ***lighttpd*** implementation or *your **demo** implementation*.

1. For the expected behavior of your implementation, please read the [specification](#Specification) section for more details.

## Specification

1. You are requested to implement parts of the HTTP/1.0 specification defined in [RFC1945](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt).

1. You only need to serve static files from the`/html` directory in the container. In case your server receives additional parameters in a request, e.g., a query string, your server should ignore that.

1. You only need to handle `GET` requests and ensure that a modern browser, such as Chrome, can browse files using your implmentation. The demo link to your server is available here ([http](http://localhost:10802/demo.html) and [https](http://localhost:10842/demo.html)).

1. Your server should respond appropriate MIME types for files based on a file&#39;s extension name. A list of typical MIME types is available [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types). You may only implement that for text, image, and audio files.

1. The default index file for a directory is `index.html`. If there is no `index.html` file in the directory, your server should return 403 status code.

1. On accessing a non-existent file or directory, your server should return a 404 status code.

1. For requesting a directory without a trailing slash, your server should return a 301 status code and redirect it to the one with a trailing slash.

1. For unsupported HTTP request methods, your server should return a 501 status code.

1. The `sw_tester` container performs workload testing against your server. Please ensure your implementation is efficient and reliable.

1. One optional requirement is to implement the support of HTTPS connections. You may leverage any SSL/TLS library you like. For example, `bearssl`, `mbedtls`, `openssl`, or `gnutls`. In case you need the server certificate and key, they are available in the `/cert` directory in the container.

## Demonstration

1. [10pts] Your server passes all simple GET requests.

1. [10pts] Your server returns status code 301 as expected.

1. [10pts] Your server returns status code 403 as expected.

1. [10pts] Your server returns status code 404 as expected.

1. [10pts] Your server returns status code 501 as expected.

1. [10pts] Your server passes the [hidden test cases](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FdcIP5-5A9pcnDnIOqSuL-cKVzZ8_T3i/view?usp=sharing) from the TAs.
 :::info
 Please download the compressed file, unzip it, and perform the following two steps:

 1. Move the entire &#34;hidden&#34; folder to the &#34;data&#34; folder
 2. Move the file &#34;run_hidden.sh&#34; to the &#34;testcase&#34; folder

 Afterward, you can use &#34;run_hidden.sh&#34; to run the hidden test cases.


 If facing permission error, please follow the following steps:
 1. remove`ro`in `line 43` and `line 44` in docker-compose.yml
 2. run the commands below:
 ```=sh
 dokcer-compose build --no-cache
 docker-compose up -d
 docker exec -it sw_tester ash
 cd testcase/
 chmod +x ./run-hidden.sh
 ```
 samples:
 ```
 tester:
 container_name: sw_tester
 build: .
 image: chuang/staticweb
 restart: unless-stopped
 volumes:
   - ./cert:/cert:ro
   - ./data:/html
   - ./testcase:/testcase
 networks:
   default:
 ```
 If facing Chinese encoding problem for our Chinese case, please help us to replace the old folder name（一堆亂碼） to the correct Chinese folder name(中文資料夾). 
 :::

1. [20pts] All resources listed in the `demo.html` page work in a typical browser.

1. [20pts] Your server passes the workload test. The score will be given based on the ranking of your implementation among all students in the class. There will be only four ranks. The top-ranked, second-ranked, third-ranked, and bottom-ranked implementations get 20pts, 15pts, 10pts, and 5pts, respectively.

1. [20pts] If your server supports SSL/TLS and passes most of the test cases listed above.
