## 1. Play with Docker

This lab aims to familiarize students with `docker` and `docker-compose` commands. Please follow the instructions to complete this lab. Once you have completed everything, please demo your implementation to a TA.

*Info:* You can do everything on your laptop or the classroom desktop PC.

### Description

1. Prepare your own docker environment. You can install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on your laptop or simply use the "docker.io" package pre-installed on the classroom desktop PC.

2. Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~chuang/courses/netprog/resources/debian/docker-compose.yml) and [Dockerfile](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~chuang/courses/netprog/resources/debian/Dockerfile) from the course website.

   *Danger:* **For Apple Chip Users (M1/M2):** You have to enable "Use Docker Compose V2" in your Docker Desktop options.

3. Build your docker container environment. Ensure that you have correctly set up your username and created the home directory for the user.

4. Follow the instructions in the introduction slide, compile textbook samples, and run in your container instance.

### Demonstration

1. [20%] Show your username and the user's home directory.
2. [20%] Ensure you have a working directory accessible from both the host and the docker runtime.
3. [20%] Rebuild the docker by removing the built one with `docker-compose rm` followed by `docker-compose up -d --build`. You don't have to remove existing docker images and caches, so the rebuild process should be very fast.
4. [20%] Run the `daytimetcpsrv` and `daytimetcpcli` samples in your docker instance.
5. [20%] Change the port number used in `daytimetcpsrv` and `daytimetcpcli`, then test the server and client again.

*Info:* **For Apple Chip Users (M1/M2):** You need to pass an additional argument `--build=arm-linux` to the `configure` command to ensure it can correctly detect your build environment.

## 2. Simple Packet Analysis

This lab aims to practice simple packet analysis using `tcpdump` (or `wireshark`). You have to interact with the server and get a secret `flag` sent from the server. Once you obtain the secret `flag` from the server, you can then ask the server to verify the correctness of the flag.

*Warning:* Most UNIX operating systems have packages for `tcpdump` and `wireshark`. Nevertheless, wireshark can be downloaded from its [official site](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html).

### Description

1. Run `tcpdump` (or `wireshark`) in your preferred environment.

   <!--
   *Danger:* Please notice that you **should not** capture packets inside a docker because the docker could strip the TOS and TTL values required by this challenge. Instead, please capture packets and then save captured packets in your host machine.
   -->

2. Connect to the challenge server by running `nc -u inp.zoolab.org 10495` from your preferred environment. This step can be done either inside or outside a docker.

3. Request a **challenge id** from the server by sending the command `hello <id>`, where `<id>` is your user id. Suppose a given `<id>` is `chuang`. You should receive an `OK` response from the server along with a **challenge id** composed of your id and a random string. `chuang_d59acd9fb5577b76f0a82990c815eed8`

4. Request a challenge using the obtained **challenge id**. You have to send a command `chals <chals_id>`, where the `<chals_id>` is the challenge id you received from the previous command.

5. The server sends many UDP packets, and each payload is in the form of `SEQ/NNNNN:message`. The `NNNNN` is a sequence number (starting from zero) for you to determine if there is any packet loss. The message can be one of the following:

   - An arbitrary length of character `A`'s.
   - The `BEGIN FLAG` message
   - The `END FLAG` message

   You can then get the `flag` of this challenge by following the steps:

   1. Recognize the packet having the payload `BEGIN FLAG`. Once you have recognized the packet, perform flag extraction using the next few steps.
   2. For each packet, obtain its **x-header-length** by summing up the **length** of the IP options and UDP payloads. Suppose 10 packets were received after the `BEGIN FLAG` packet. You should get 10 **x-header-length**s.
   3. Convert each **x-header-length** into its corresponding ASCII character.
   4. The secret `flag` can be obtained by concatenating each ASCII character obtained in the second step in its order.
   5. You can find the end of the flag by recognizing the `END FLAG` message in a packet's UDP payload.

6. Decode the flag and verify if your flag is correct by connecting to the challenge server and using the `verfy <flag>` command to verify your decoded flag. The server responds `GOOD JOB!` if your flag is correct.

   <!--
   *Warning:* If you have difficulties capturing packets, you may consider using our captured pcap file from [here](https://inp111.zoolab.org/lab01.2/lab_tcpdump.pcap). You can check the TTL values for packets stored in the pcap file. The SHA1 value for the pcap file is: ``ba332a3c528d68c5c6874aae681929199dbb6c98``
   -->

### Demonstration

1. [50%] If you can implement a program to request the server to send challenges. Your program should be able to send different user id requested by the TAs.
2. [30%] If you can capture the challenge packets, save them in a `pcap` file, and decode a correct flag from the saved packets.
3. [20%] If your program can perform the above two steps in a single implementation (command) and display the decoded flag in the terminal.
4. For steps (2) and (3), the flag verification process can be performed manually.

*Warning:* A sample pcap file can be downloaded from [here](https://inp.zoolab.org/netprog/lab01/test.pcap).

*Info:* Your program may handle the outputs from the command `tcpdump -ni any -Xxnv udp and port 10495`.

*Info:* Note that your script (or program) can use a saved `pcap` file created by `tcpdump` or `wireshark` as its input.

## Network Issues

If you have network connection issue with our challenge server, you can download the server binary from [here](https://inp.zoolab.org/netprog/lab01/udpflag_release), and run it in your Linux docker using the command

```bash sudo ./udpflag_release 10495 ```

*Danger:* You need root permission to run the server program.

Please note that you need to grant execution permission to the downloaded executable. If you are working with an Apple chip Mac, you have to install Rosetta (x86_64 emulation) to run this executable in your Linux Docker.

If everything is fine, the server should only display a single message `server: running on port 10495`.

If you have successfully invoked the server, you should be able to connect to the server using the command:

```bash nc -u 127.0.0.1 10495 ```

and the behavior should be the same as the remote challenge server.
